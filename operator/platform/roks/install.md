##  Step 1: Get access to the container images

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. In the OpenShift web console menu bar, click your profile *IAM#user.name@email.com* > *Copy Login Command* and paste the copied command into your command line.
   ```bash
   $ oc login https://<CLUSTERNAME>:<CLUSTERPORT> --token=<GENERATED_TOKEN>
   ```
2. Run a `kubectl` command to make sure that you have access to Kubernetes.
   ```bash
   $ kubectl cluster-info
   ```
3. Download or clone the repository on your local machine and change to `container-samples` directory
   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:ibm-ecm/container-samples.git
   $ cd container-samples/operator/
   ```
   The `container-samples/operator` directory includes all of the scripts and descriptors that are needed to install Cloud Pak for Automation.

4. Create a project for each release that you want to install by running the following commands.
   ```bash
   $ oc new-project <project_name> --description="<description>" --display-name="<display_name>"
   ```
5. Make sure that your entitled container images are available and accessible in one of the IBM docker registries. Use either **option 1** or **option 2**.

### Option 1: Create a pull secret for the IBM Cloud Entitled Registry

1. Log in to [MyIBM Container Software Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) with the IBMid and password that are associated with the entitled software.

2. In the **Container software library** tile, click **View library** and then click **Copy key** to copy the entitlement key to the clipboard.

3. Create a pull secret by running a `kubectl create secret` command.
   ```bash
   $ kubectl create secret docker-registry admin.registrykey --docker-server=cp.icr.io --docker-username=iamapikey --docker-password="<API_KEY_GENERATED>" --docker-email=<USER_EMAIL>
   ```

   > **Note**: The `cp.icr.io` value for the **docker-server** parameter is the only registry domain name that contains the images. The `cp.icr.io` and `cp` values for the **docker-server** and **docker-username** parameters must be used.

4. Take a note of the secret and the server values so that you can set them to the **pullSecrets** and **repository** parameters when you run the operator for your containers.

### Option 2: Download the packages from PPA and load the images

[IBM Passport Advantage (PPA)](https://www-01.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/pao_customer.html) provides archives (.tgz) for the software. To view the list of Passport Advantage eAssembly installation images, refer to the [20.0.1 download document](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-cloud-pak-automation-v2001-download-document).

1. Download one or more PPA packages to a server that is connected to your Docker registry.

2. Check that you can run a docker command.
   ```bash
   $ docker ps
   ```
3. Log in to the Docker registry with a token.
   ```bash
   $ docker login $(oc registry info) -u <ADMINISTRATOR> -p $(oc whoami -t)
   ```

   You can also log in to an external Docker registry using the following command:
   ```bash
   $ docker login <registry_url> -u <your_account>
   ```
4. Run a `kubectl` command to make sure that you have access to Kubernetes.
   ```bash
   $ kubectl cluster-info
   ```
5. Download the loadimages.sh script. Change the permissions so that you can run the script.
   ```bash
   $ chmod +x loadimages.sh
   ```
6. Use the [`scripts/loadimages.sh`](../../scripts/loadimages.sh) script to push the images into the IBM Cloud Container Registry.Specify the two mandatory parameters in the command line.

   ```
   -p  PPA archive files location or archive filename
   -r  Target Docker registry and namespace
   -l  Optional: Target a local registry
   ```
   The following example shows the input values in the command line.
   ```bash
   ./loadimages.sh -p <PPA-ARCHIVE>.tgz -r <registry_domain_name>/<project_name>
   ```

   > Note: A registry domain name is associated with your cluster location. The name us.icr.io for example, is for the region us-south. The region and registry domain names are listed on the https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry. The default docker registry is based on the host name, for example "default-route-openshift-image-registry.ibm.com". The project must have pull request privileges to the registry where the images are loaded. The project must also have pull request privileges to push the images into another namespace/project.

7. After you push the images to the registry, check whether they are pushed correctly by running the following command.
   ```bash
   $ ibmcloud cr images --restrict <project_name>
   ```
8. Create a pull secret to be able to pull images from the IBM Cloud Container Registry.
   ```bash
   $ kubectl <project_name> create secret docker-registry admin.registrykey \
   --docker-server=<registry_domain_name> --docker-username=iamapikey \
   --docker-password="<APIKEY>" --docker-email=<IBMID> --namespace 
   ```
   To generate an API KEY, go to Security > Manage > Identity and Access > IBM Cloud API Keys in the IBM Cloud menu and select Generate an IBM Cloud API key.

9. Take a note of the secret names so that you can set them to the **pullSecrets** parameter when you run the installation for your containers.
10. (Optional) If you want to use an external Docker registry, create a Docker registry secret.
   ```bash
   $ oc create secret docker-registry <secret_name> --docker-server=<registry_url> --docker-username=<your_account> --docker-password=<your_password> --docker-email=<your_email>
   ```
   Take a note of the secret and the server values so that you can set them to the **pullSecrets** and **repository** parameters when you run the operator for your containers.


## Step 2: Prepare the cluster for automation software

Before you install any of the containerized software:

1. Go to the prerequisites page in the [IBM FileNet Content Manager 5.5.4](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.5.0/com.ibm.p8.containers.doc/containers_prepare.htm) Knowledge Center.
2. Follow the instructions on preparing your environment for the software components that you want to install.

  How much preparation you need to do depends on what you want to install and how familiar you are with your environment.

## Step 3: Create a shared PVC and add the JDBC drivers

  IBM Public Cloud ROKS cluster by default attached to an endurance storage which comes with pre-defined storage classes. In order to copy the JDBC drivers to Operator pod you will need to create a new storage class with the following storage requirements to allow copy of JDBC drivers.
   1. Use one of the available storage classes with "gid". (ibmc-file-bronze-gid , ibmc-file-retain-gold , ibmc-file-silver-gid )
   2. Apply the new storage class yaml
      ```bash
      $ oc apply -f operator-sc.yaml
   
   3. Create a claim for a PV dynamically , [descriptors/operator-shared-pvc.yaml](../../descriptors/operator-shared-pvc.yaml?raw=true).

        > Replace the storage class with the name of the storage class from Step 1. Which is (ibmc-file-bronze-gid , ibmc-file-retain-gold , ibmc-file-silver-gid )

   2. Deploy the PVC.
        ```bash
        $ oc create -f descriptors/operator-shared-pvc.yaml
        ```
        Run the following commands to get the bound PV name and the PV location.
        ```bash
        $ oc get pvc | grep operator-shared-pvc
        $ oc describe PV PV_name
        ```

  4. Copy all of the JDBC drivers that are needed by the components you intend to install to the persistent volume. Depending on your storage configuration you might not need these drivers.

     > **Note**: File names for JDBC drivers cannot include additional version information.
       - DB2:
          - db2jcc4.jar
          - db2jcc_license_cu.jar
       - Oracle:
          - ojdbc8.jar
       - SQLServer:
          - mssql-jdbc.jre8.jar

      The following structure shows an example remote file system.

      ```
      pv-root-dir

         └── jdbc

            ├── db2

            │   ├── db2jcc4.jar

            │   └── db2jcc_license_cu.jar

            ├── oracle

            │   └── ojdbc8.jar

            └── sqlserver

               └── mssql-jdbc.jre8.jar
      ```

## Step 4: Create or reuse a Docker registry secret

In your target namespace, you must create a Docker registry secret if you want to use an external Docker registry or reuse a secret in the target project if you want to use an internal Docker registry.      

```yaml
imagePullSecrets:
   name: "admin.registrykey"
```

> **Note**: The secret_name must match the imagePullSecrets.name parameter in the operator custom resource definition (.yaml) file, for example, admin.registrykey.

For an external Docker registry.

```bash
$ oc create secret docker-registry admin.registrykey --docker-server=<registry_url> --docker-username=<your_account> --docker-password=<your_password> --docker-email=fncmtest@ibm.com
```

For an internal Docker registry.

```bash
$ oc project <my-project>
$ oc get secret
```

## Step 5: Deploy the operator to your cluster

The operator has a number of descriptors that must be applied.
  - [descriptors/fncm_v1_fncm_crd.yaml](../../descriptors/fncm_v1_fncm_crd.yaml?raw=true) contains the description of the Custom Resource Definition.
  - [descriptors/operator.yaml](../../descriptors/operator.yaml?raw=true) defines the deployment of the operator code.
  - [descriptors/role.yaml](../../descriptors/role.yaml?raw=true) defines the access of the operator.
  - [descriptors/role_binding.yaml](../../descriptors/role_binding.yaml?raw=true) defines the access of the operator.
  - [descriptors/service_account.yaml](../../descriptors/service_account.yaml?raw=true) defines the identity for processes that run inside the pods of the operator. 
  
1. Modify the `image` parameter for containers (ansible and operator) and the `imagePullSecrets` name in `descriptors/operator.yaml` to a valid image registry URL. The value for `imagePullSecrets` name is the secret that you created in [Step 4](install.md#step-4-create-or-reuse-a-docker-registry-secret).

   ```yaml

   containers:
      - name: ansible
          # Replace this with the built image name
          image: "cp.icr.io/cp/cp4a/fncm-operator:ga-5.5.4"   
     -    
     -   
     - name: operator
          # Replace this with the built image name
          image: "cp.icr.io/cp/cp4a/fncm-operator:ga-5.5.4"      
    
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: "admin.registrykey"
   ```


2. Edit the namespace spec in the `service_account.yaml` and `operator.yaml` files.

   ```yaml
   metadata:
      name: ibm-fncm-operator
      namespace: <my-project>
   ```

3. ( 5.5.4 GA only not required for 5.5.4 iFix001 ) Apply the [Security Context Constraints (SCC)](../../descriptors/scc-fncm.yaml) that are needed for FileNet Content Manager:

   ```bash
   $ oc apply -f descriptors/scc-fncm.yaml
   ```

   > **Note**: `fsGroup` and `supplementalGroups` are `RunAsAny` and  `runAsUser` is `MustRunAsRange`.

   ```yaml
   fsGroup:
      type: RunAsAny
      ...
      ...
   runAsUser:
      type: MustRunAsRange
      ...
      ...
   supplementalGroups:
      type: RunAsAny
   ```

4. Prepare and deploy the ibm-fncm-operator on your cluster.

   The script [deployOperator.sh](../../scripts/deployOperator.sh) can be used to deploy the descriptors and the operator pod.
   ```bash
   $ ./scripts/deployOperator.sh -i <registry_url>/ibm-fncm-operator:latest -p '<secret_name>' -n <Namespace>
   ```

   > **Note**: If you do not specify the -i and -n options the operator is deployed in the default namespace at this URL: master_node:8500/default/ibm-fncm-operator:v1.0.0. If you plan to use a non-admin user to install the operator, you must add the user to the `icp4operator` role. For example:
   ```bash
   $ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user ibm-fncm-operator <user_name>
   ```   
   If you want to deploy the operator YAML files without using the deployOperator.sh script, you can use the deploy command to deploy each file, for example:
   ```bash
   oc apply -f ./descriptors/fncm_v1_fncm_crd.yaml
   oc apply -f ./descriptors/service_account.yaml
   oc apply -f ./descriptors/role.yaml
   oc apply -f ./descriptors/role_bingding.yaml
   oc apply -f ./descriptors/operator.yaml
   ``` 

5. Monitor the pod until it shows a STATUS of *Running* or *Completed*:
   ```bash
   $ oc get pods -w  | grep -v -E "(Running|Completed|STATUS)"; do sleep 5; done
   $ oc logs -f <operator-pod> -c operator
   ```

## Step 6: Configure the software that you want to install

1. Make a copy of the template custom resources YAML file [fncm_v1_fncm_cr_template.yaml](../../descriptors/fncm_v1_fncm_cr_template.yaml?raw=true) and name it appropriately for your deployment (for example my_fncm_v1_fncm_cr.yaml).

   > **Important:** Because the maximum length of labels in Kubernetes is 63 characters, be careful with the lengths of your CR name and instance names. Some components can configure multiple instances, each instance must have a different name. The total length of the CR name and an instance name must not exceed 24 characters, otherwise some component deployments fail.
   
   You must use a single custom resource file to include all of the components that you want to deploy with an operator instance. Each time that you need to make an update or modification you must use this same file to apply the changes to your deployments. When you apply a new custom resource to an operator you must make sure that all previously deployed resources are included if you do not want the operator to delete them.

2. Change the default name of your instance in descriptors/my_fncm_v1_fncm_cr.yaml:

   ```yaml
   metadata:
     name: <MY-INSTANCE>
   ```
   
3. If you use an internal registry, enter values for the `image_pull_secrets` and `images` parameters with the information that you noted from [Step 4](install.md#step-4-create-or-reuse-a-docker-registry-secret) in the `shared_configuration` section.

   ```yaml
   shared_configuration:
     image_pull_secrets:
     - pull-secret
    ```

4. Use the information in [Configure IBM FileNet Content Manager](../../FNCM/README_config.md) to configure the software that you want to install. When you have completed all entries into your deployment copy of the `fncm_v1_fncm_cr_template.yaml` file, return to these instructions to continue the deployment.

## Step 7: Apply the custom resources

Use the customized `fncm_v1_fncm_cr_template.yaml` file that you updated for your software and environment, and run the following commands to deploy the configured components:

   ```bash
   $ cat descriptors/my_fncm_v1_fncm_cr.yaml
   // check that all the components you want to install are configured
   $ oc apply -f descriptors/my_fncm_v1_fncm_cr.yaml
   ```

## Step 8: Verify that the operator and pods are running

Deployment can take a few minutes, and can take longer if more applications are configured and included in your custom YAML.

When all of the pods are *Running*, you can access the status of your containers with the following commands.
```bash
$ oc status
$ oc get deployment
```

## Step 9: Complete some post-installation steps

If you installed Content Manager and IBM Content Navigator, you must complete additional post deployment tasks to make sure your environment is up and running. See [Completing post-deployment startup tasks for a new domain](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.5.0/com.ibm.p8.containers.doc/containers_postdeploy.htm) to follow the post-installation steps. Your tasks will vary depending on whether you used the Initialization and Verify containers to set up your environment.

If you deployed the Content Services GraphQL container, you must complete the steps to configure authentication, logging, and so on. For more information, see [Configuring the Content Services GraphQL API](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.5.0/com.ibm.p8.containers.doc/containers_graphql.htm).

## Step 10: Troubleshooting

The `ibm-fncm-operator` deployment on a cluster creates an `operator` and `ansible` container. The `ansible` container shows the standard Ansible stdout logs. To see the logs of a container, run the following command:

```bash
$ oc logs deployment/ibm-fncm-operator -c ansible
```

The `operator` logs contain much more information about the operator than Kubernetes does.
```bash
$ oc logs deployment/ibm-fncm-operator -c operator
```

For runtime Ansible logs, go inside the pod that runs the `ansible` container, and look at the `/tmp/ansible-operator/runner/<group>/<version>/<kind>/<namespace>/<name>/artifacts/<jod-id>/stdout` directory.

```bash
$ oc rsh ibm-fncm-operator-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx
```
